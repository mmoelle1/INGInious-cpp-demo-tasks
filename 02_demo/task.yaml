       This is a generic C++ demo tasks for the INGInious platform. It uses three sub-problems to let the student

       *   fill in the C++ source code (Question 1), 
       *   choose a C++ standard (Question 2),
       *   provide additional command line arguments (Question 3), and
       *   upload an additional file (Question 4).

       **C++ Source Code**

       This demo task assumes that the entire source code is given in
       a single file and provides the ``main`` function that is called
       when the program is executed. The user-provided source code is
       parsed to ensure that the ``main`` function has one of the
       following signatures:

       *   ``int main()``
       *   ``int main(int argc, char* argv[])``
       *   ``int main(int argc, char** argv)``

       All other signatures will lead to an error message. Multi-line implementations are possible, e.g.,

       .. code:: cpp

          int
          
          main ( 
                 int argc ,
                 char** argv
               )

       *Technical details*:

       The user-provided source code is substituted into the file
       ``student/student_code.cxx``, which is auto-generated by the
       ``run`` script from the template file
       ``student/student_code.cxx.tpl``.  To enable support for all of
       the above variants of the ``main`` function, the user-provided
       ``main`` function is renamed to ``__main__`` and called from
       the ``test_student_code`` function that is provided in the file
       ``student/bridge.cxx``, which is itself auto-generated from the
       template file ``student/bridge.cxx.tpl``. This way, the
       ``test_student_code()`` function has a unique interface and the
       possibly provided command line arguments are pre-processed
       internally; cf. ``student/bridge.cxx`` file.

       **C++ Standards**

       The choice of the C++ standard is realized as multiple-choice
       problem that accepts exactly one answer. The user's choice is
       taken into account in the file ``student/config/Makefile.inc``,
       which is auto-generated from the file
       ``student/config/Makefile.inc.tpl``:

       .. code:: makefile

          # C++11 (student_cxx_standard multiple choice: 0)
          CXXFLAGS_EXTRA_0 = -std=gnu++11
          LDFLAGS_EXTRA_0  = -std=gnu++11

          # C++14 (student_cxx_standard multiple choice: 1)
          CXXFLAGS_EXTRA_1 = -std=gnu++14
          LDFLAGS_EXTRA_1  = -std=gnu++14

          ...

          CXXFLAGS_EXTRA   = -O3 -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-variadic-macros -Wvla -Wall -Wextra -Werror ${CXXFLAGS_EXTRA_@@student_cxx_standard@@}
          LDFLAGS_EXTRA    = -O3 -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-variadic-macros -Wvla -Wall -Wextra -Werror ${LDFLAGS_EXTRA_@@student_cxx_standard@@}

       In order to add further configurations, add a new choice to the
       ``task.yaml`` file and provide variables ``CXXFLAGS_EXTRA_X``
       and ``LDFLAGS_EXTRA_X`` for the newly added choice ``X``.

       The compiler is intentionally called with very pedantic
       settings to report warnings as errors. For some of these
       warnings, the ``run`` script provides additional information,
       e.g., the error triggered by the compiler flag
       ``-Werror=reorder`` is translated into the feedback string

       *"Your code misses a return statement in line ... for a function that was declared to return a non-void type"*

       Additional feedback strings can be integrated into the ``run``
       script. If INGInious' `highlight plugin
       <https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious-highlight-plugin>`_ is
       installed and activated, the line of the first error is
       highlighted red.

       **Command Line Arguments**

       Command line arguments can be passed by providing them in
       quotes and separated by commas in Question 3.

       **File upload**

       An additional text file can be uploaded via the file upload
       diaglog in Question 4. This file is available from within the
       C++ source code under the same file name.
