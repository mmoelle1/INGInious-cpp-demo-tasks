INGInious C++ demonstration tasks
=================================

This repository hosts C++ demonstration tasks for the INGInious platform.

Please note that these require one of the container images cpp-gcc5, cpp-gcc6, cpp-gcc7, and cpp-gcc8 from PR https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious-containers/pull/31 to be installed on the system. All C++11 and C++14 features are supported by GCC 5 and better. Most C++17 features require GCC 7 or better. Features from the C++2a working draft are partily implemented in GCC 8, others require GCC 9 which is not yet available as container image.

The default setting in all demo tasks is GCC 8.
